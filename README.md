Hello there, let's get started with Git. 

* Here, we'll go through the basics of git. 

* From adding code,  making changes committing the code to pushing the code and fetching it to and from the remote repository. 

Branching: 
    1. One of the main aspect of git is branches. Here, we'll see how to create branches in git and how to switch between and compare different branches. 

    2. The act of switching between branches is called checkout. 

    3. we use the git branch command to list out the branches, the local branches only. 

    4. Here, we create a new branch, using the following command: git checkout -b New_branch:
    The -b creates the branch "New_branch" and checks it out - meaning switches to the New_branch.
